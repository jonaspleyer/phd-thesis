\textbf{Language of cellular \acp{abm}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item we have defined in clear (abstract) terms what an \ac{abm} is
    \item therefore we can now formally talk and argue about \acp{abm} and their implementation
    \item previously everyone did something different; now somewhat unified
    \item not all \ac{abm} will be fully compatible with this approach
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\ac{abm} Ansatz not fully realized}
\begin{itemize}
    \item this thesis mostly about methods
    \item not many applications
    \item furthermore \ac{abm} are good for combining many different elements (i.e. intracellular
        reactions, extracellular, cycle, mechanics, etc.); this was also just done partially
    \item this is also why we have suggested an experiment together with a model in
        section (\todo{link to section})
\end{itemize}
